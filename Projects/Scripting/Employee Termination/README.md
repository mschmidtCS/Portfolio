# Employee Termination Automation Script

This interactive PowerShell script is designed to automate the offboarding process for terminated employees in Active Directory and Microsoft 365 environments.

## üîß Features

Upon execution, the script performs the following actions for a specified user:

1. **Disables the user's AD account**
2. **Clears sensitive AD attributes:**
   - City
   - State
   - Job Title
   - Department
   - Manager
   - Direct Reports  
   *(Clearing these attributes triggers removal from Dynamic Groups during the next AD Connect sync cycle.)*
3. **Appends the disable date to the user's AD Description field**
4. **Removes the user from all Active Directory groups**
5. **Removes all assigned Microsoft 365 licenses**
6. **Removes the user from all Distribution Lists**
7. **Removes the user from all Microsoft 365 and security groups**
8. **Revokes access to Shared Mailboxes**
9. **Logs all actions taken**  
   *(Logs include timestamps, actions performed, and what objects/permissions were removed.)*

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

> üí° Run the script with elevated privileges on a machine with RSAT tools, Exchange Online, and MSOnline/Graph modules installed.
