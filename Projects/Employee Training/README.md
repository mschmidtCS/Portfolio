# Online Security Awareness Program  
*Powered by Kaseya BullPhish ID*

This program is designed to enhance employee awareness and resilience against phishing and social engineering attacks using BullPhish ID’s simulated phishing and training platform.

## 🎯 Purpose

To reduce the likelihood of security breaches by:
- Simulating real-world phishing attacks
- Delivering engaging security training content
- Tracking user behavior and risk levels
- Reinforcing cybersecurity best practices

## 🔧 Program Components

### 🧪 Phishing Simulations

### 📈 Reporting & Monitoring
- Dashboard view of:
  - Open rates
  - Click-throughs
  - Credential submissions
  - Training completion
- Executive-level reports delivered monthly
- Risk scoring per user and department

I have automated reportes coming from Bullphish that are then imported into a PowerBI dashboard for better reporting and viewaility for the management team.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Sync & Grouping**  
   Users are imported using Active Directory groups.

2. **Phishing Campaigns**  
   Simulations are scheduled at regular intervals with randomized delivery windows to mimic real-world patterns.

3. **Training Delivery**  
   Users receive training via email with links to BullPhish-hosted videos and quizzes on a quarterly basis.

4. **Feedback & Logging**  
   Users who fall for a simulation are directed to a landing page with guidance. All actions are logged.

## 📅 Maintenance Schedule

| Task                            | Frequency       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Update phishing templates       | Monthly         |
| Review training module library  | Quarterly       |
| User/group sync validation      | Weekly          |
| Risk report generation          | Monthly         |

## ✅ Best Practices

- Randomize templates and send times.
- Reinforce simulations with manager follow-up.
- Rotate training topics regularly.

## 🔐 Compliance and Privacy

- BullPhish ID is compliant with data protection standards.
- No real credentials are captured—simulations are safe and educational.
- Logs and results are retained according to internal data retention policies.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
