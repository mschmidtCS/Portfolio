# Online Security Awareness Program  
*Powered by Kaseya BullPhish ID*

This program is designed to enhance employee awareness and resilience against phishing and social engineering attacks using BullPhish ID’s simulated phishing and training platform.

## 🎯 Purpose

To reduce the likelihood of security breaches by:
- Simulating real-world phishing attacks
- Delivering engaging security training content
- Tracking user behavior and risk levels
- Reinforcing cybersecurity best practices

## 🔧 Program Components

### 🧪 Phishing Simulations
- Scheduled simulations across departments
- Realistic emails mimicking common phishing tactics
- Configurable templates (custom branding & language)
- Landing pages with educational messaging after click

### 📚 Training Campaigns
- Curated content library on:
  - Phishing
  - Password hygiene
  - Social engineering
  - Ransomware and data breaches
- Monthly training modules
- Auto-enrollment for new hires
- Progress tracking and quiz completion records

### 📈 Reporting & Monitoring
- Dashboard view of:
  - Open rates
  - Click-throughs
  - Credential submissions
  - Training completion
- Executive-level reports delivered monthly
- Risk scoring per user and department

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Sync & Grouping**  
   Users are imported and grouped by department or role using Active Directory or CSV sync.

2. **Phishing Campaigns**  
   Simulations are scheduled at regular intervals with randomized delivery windows to mimic real-world patterns.

3. **Training Delivery**  
   Users receive training via email with links to BullPhish-hosted videos and quizzes.

4. **Feedback & Logging**  
   Users who fall for a simulation are directed to a landing page with guidance. All actions are logged.

## 📅 Maintenance Schedule

| Task                            | Frequency       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Update phishing templates       | Monthly         |
| Review training module library  | Quarterly       |
| User/group sync validation      | Weekly          |
| Risk report generation          | Monthly         |

## ✅ Best Practices

- Avoid sending simulations during company-wide announcements or downtime.
- Randomize templates and send times.
- Reinforce simulations with manager follow-up.
- Rotate training topics regularly.

## 🔐 Compliance and Privacy

- BullPhish ID is compliant with data protection standards.
- No real credentials are captured—simulations are safe and educational.
- Logs and results are retained according to internal data retention policies.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
