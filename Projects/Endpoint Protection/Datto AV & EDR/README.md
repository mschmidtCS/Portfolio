# Datto AV/EDR Implementation  

This documents the deployment, configuration, and ongoing management of **Datto AV/EDR** as part of an organization-wide initiative to improve endpoint protection, detection, and response capabilities.

## 🛡️ Overview

Datto AV/EDR provides next-generation antivirus and endpoint detection & response features that protect against ransomware, zero-day attacks, and advanced persistent threats. This implementation ensures all endpoints across the organization are monitored, hardened, and capable of responding to suspicious behavior in real time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Standardize endpoint protection across all managed devices
- Leverage behavioral analytics and AI-powered threat detection
- Establish rapid incident response capabilities
- Integrate threat alerts with centralized monitoring and SOC tools

## 🔧 Key Features Enabled

- ✅ Behavioral and signature-based malware detection  
- ✅ Ransomware detection and automatic process termination
- ✅ Weekly scheduled AV and EDR scans on all managed devices
- ✅ Suspicious activity alerting  
- ✅ Automated quarantine and rollback actions  
- ✅ Centralized dashboard with real-time visibility  
- ✅ EDR timeline analysis for investigation and response  
- ✅ Remote remediation capabilities

## 🖥️ Deployment Summary

| Task                                  | Method/Tool Used        |
