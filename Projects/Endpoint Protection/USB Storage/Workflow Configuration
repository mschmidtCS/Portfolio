Configuration
  
  - This script is scheduled to run on a weekly basis to ensure complete coverage
  - The script first looks at the system tags we have assigned in VSA X. 
    - If the device has the USB allow tag, then it will run the script to Enable access.
    - If the device does not have the tag, then it will run the script to Disable access.
